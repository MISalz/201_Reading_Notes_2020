# HTML
Links use \<a>

\<a href="http://google.com">Google</a>

\<a href="mailto:parentfolder@class.org">email</a>

linking to a specific part of a page use the

\<p id="#header"\> this link will redirect you to an area within a page\</p>

### Directory 
 * top level folder = Root (otherwise knowsn as parent folder)
 * second level folders are child folders
 * every page and image on a website has an url

 ***relative urls are links within the same root folders***

***css treats each html element as if it is in its own box***

### Postioning Schemes
* normal flow = position:**static**
* relative positioning = position:**relative**
* absolute positioning = position:**absolute**
* fixed positioning = position:**fixed**
* floating elements = position:**floating**
* overlapping elements = Z-index:**10**

you can use float:"side" to group elements side by side

# JS
* *Code block consists of one or more statements contained within curly braces. You do not write a semicolon after the closing curly brace*

* *Programming languages often rely upon on name/value pairs.*


## Declaring a function 
To  create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements to achieve its task inside the curly  braces.

## Calling a function
Having a declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code.

*when you call a function that has parameters you specify the values it should use in the parentheses*


| Argument as Value | Argument as VAR |
---|---
| getArea(3,5); | getArea(width,height) |
