'''javascript

# JS
* *Code block consists of one or more statements contained within curly braces. You do not write a semicolon after the closing curly brace*

* *Programming languages often rely upon on name/value pairs.*

## Declaring a function 
To  create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements to achieve its task inside the curly  braces.

## Calling a function
Having a declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code.

*when you call a function that has parameters you specify the values it should use in the parentheses*

| Argument as Value | Argument as VAR |
---|---
| getArea(3,5); | getArea(width,height) |
