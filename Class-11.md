aligning images can be done by using float property witha  class property

**by default images are inline elements**
* In order to center an image it should be turned into a block element ex \<p>
you can use the text-align property to center the value

to add a image to backgound use - background-image:
### Repeating images
background-attachment: | |
---|---
Repeat | The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the background- repeat property isn't used).
repeat-x | The image is repeated horizontally only (as shown in the first example on the left).
repeat-y| The image is repeated vertically only.
no-repeat |The image is only shown once. 


The background-attachment property specifies whether a background image should stay in one position or move as the user scrolls up and down the page. It can have one of two values:| |
---|---
| fixed | The background image stays in the same position on the page.
| scroll | The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.

background position: \(to align the image to particular area in the page)

## background short hand
background:  The properties must be specified in the following order, but you can miss any value if you do not want to specify it.|
---|---
1: background-color |
2: background-image |
3: background-repeat |
4: background-attachment |
 5: background-position |

## CSS3 will also support the use of multiple background images by repeating the background shorthand. |
 ---|---
| div \{ background: url\(example-1.jpg) top left no-repeat, url\(example-2.jpg) bottom left no-repeat, url|(example-3.jpg) centre top repeat-x;} |

* ** if you want to verlay text on a backgfound image the images must be low contrast in order for the text to be legible**

# chpt 19  SEO SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION

Search engine optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying
to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.

On-page techniques are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines.

Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your
site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours.

## on page seo
1: Page title
2: url / WeB address
3: headings
4: text
5: link text
6: image alt text
7: Page descriPtions


### Analytics
As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by Google called Google Analytics.

### FTP
To transfer your code and images from your computer to your hosting company, you use something known as File Transfer Protocol.
