## Object
Objects grouop together a set of variables  and functions to create a model

If a variable is part of an object it is known as a **property**
	* Properties tell us about the object
If a function is part of an object its called a **method**
	* Methods represent tasks that are associate with the object
Variables with a name an a value inside an object are called a **Key**
An object cannot have two keys with same name. 
The value  of a property can be any value type
## Literal Notation
 is the easiest way to creat objects
All keys have actual values
## Dot Notation
You can access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation
You access a property or method of an object by using the name of the object followed by a period then the name of the property. The period is known as the **member operator**.
	Var hotelName =hotel.name;
	Car roomsFree = hotel.checkAvailability();
You can also access properties using square brackets
	Var hotelName = hotel['name']
