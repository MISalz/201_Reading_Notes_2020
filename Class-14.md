Teams are successful if they share common goals, take the time to get to know each other on a personal level and have emotional intelligence.

Some of the teams that best performed were teams who were aware of how others felt and although they may have strong ideas they were willing to participate at their turn and allowed others to have input. 

Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel — that can’t really be optimized.
